# Code Green! The sustainability data hackathon and workshop, sponsored by Thoughtworks (Event HJS304 at Re:Invent 2021)


Are you a builder that loves our Earth? If so, come code ‘green’ with us and build solutions that empower a sustainable future. Choose your learning path in this **three part event**:
- Hack on your ideas for carbon emissions reduction, preserving biodiversity, and more (8 AM – 6:30 PM)
- Drop-in anytime to walk through a guided workshop and get hands-on with climate data (8 AM – 6:30 PM)
- Socialize with industry leaders like Adrian Cockcroft and others. (6:30 PM – 8 PM)

Register for HJS304 in the re:Invent attendee portal to attend any of the above.

## Hackathon
The Code Green Hackathon is an all-day coding event for builders to solve a sustainability-related technical challenge. Entries will leverage sustainability data available in the *Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)* or *AWS Data Exchange (ADX)*. Prizes include reMarkable 2 paper tablets, $50k AWS credits, plus all registrants have their air travel offset with carbon credits.

### Workshop 
An in-person sustainability workshop is offered for attendees who would prefer a more guided (but still hands-on) experience. The workshop is offered in the same room as the hackathon and takes about 2 hours. Builders will leverage AWS and ASDI to build a solution that can reduce heating and cooling costs for events.  You can access the workshop content [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/v2/workshops/e2226f3d-4c4c-4a4a-bf8b-4f05209f02fd/en-US). 
 
Register as usual and drop-in anytime to participate. All registrants have their air travel offset with carbon credits.

### Problem and Datasets
Hackers will use AWS build a solution that addresses the global climate crisis. Impactful topics and use cases include, but are not limited to, reducing carbon emissions, protecting diversity, reducing waste, and replenishing water.

You will be expected to create a solution utilizing the datasets offered by AWS Data Exchange (ADX) and ASDI that addresses a sustainability focused problem. To help guide your ideas, we have selected a few datasets that might be useful for getting started. Please note you are not limited to these options. 

To take advantage of these datasets, please refer to the [ASDI guide](/ASDI-Instructions.md) and [ADX Guide](/ADX-Instructions.md) we created.


### Awards, Judges, and Judging Criteria
Thoughtworks is offsetting the carbon emissions of flights for everyone registered for CodeGreen. Expect food, drinks, and meaningful prize packages that will help winners take their solution further on AWS, including a total of $50,000 credit!!

The real winner? Earth of course.

Judges will assess solutions’ impact, innovation, architecture, data usage, and readiness. Please refer to the [score card](/scorecard.md) for more details.


### Delivery Method
All hackers will recieve AWS credits to freely access necessary AWS resources and services. Teams will consist of 2-6 hackers.

Teams can work from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM , and time will be set aside at the end for demos.
