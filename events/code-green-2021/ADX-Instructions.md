### Getting Started 

Getting up and running with AWS Data Exchange:

1. Log into your AWS Account. Navigate to the [AWS Data Exchange Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dataexchange/)
2. If you have not used AWS Data Exchange before, we recommend you complete this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/heartbeat.html) before you go to familiarize yourself with exporting data from the service. 
3. You will find that you have a few offers to free data products made available by our ESG providers Arabesque, and Amenity Analytics in your ‘My product offers’ tab on the Left Nav.
